# html-stuff
Here lies all my hyper text documents. 


I have all html documents from the website I built in college. 

Also here is some of the work I have done on Clayton County Public School's K1000 platform. These documents represent the main landing page, email documents for updates and helpdesk articles. The main landing page and helpdesk document were made with my raw HTML and Dell KACE K1000 editing tools.
